A virtual favicon pet!

## Backstory
About 2 years ago, before getting my first job as a software engineer, I was briefly enfactuated with the idea of favicons.
Something about the limitations of favicons (being at max 32x32 pixels) spoke to me, so inspired by [Defender](http://www.p01.org/defender_of_the_favicon/) I decided to take on a brief project.
Out of this came favigochi, the worlds first (as far as I'm aware) favicon-based pet simulator.
